  Community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by total metric tons of CO2
  equivalent, by metric tons per capita, and by metric tons per regional GDP.
  GDP is not reported at the City level but at the Metropolitan Statistical
  Area. The metric tons per GDP is therefore only an estimate for the City.
