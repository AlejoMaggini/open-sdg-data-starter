Data for this indicator is being tracked by the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural 
Affairs (DCA).  DCA has created a Neighborhood Arts Profile (http://neighborhoodartsprofile.org); data-informed visualizations of the City’s arts and cultural infrastructure to help increase the region’s understanding of existing service gaps that impede the overall health of the community.  The resulting data visualizations aggregate and map Los Angeles arts and cultural infrastructure, providing a data-informed understanding of the City’s entire cultural ecosystem.
