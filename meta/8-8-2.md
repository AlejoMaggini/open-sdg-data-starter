**Non-Statistical Indicator**

California has some of the most stringent labor laws in the United States. This includes a $12 minimum wage ($15 in the City of Los Angeles), overtime pay laws, vacation laws, and protections for independent contractors. The Labor Commissioner's Office in the State of California Department of Industrial Relations is responsible for ensuring a just day's pay in every workplace in the State and to promote economic justice through robust enforcement of labor laws.
