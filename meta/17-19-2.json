In 1954, Congress codified earlier census acts and all other statutes authorizing the decennial census as [Title 13, U.S. Code](https://www.census.gov/history/www/reference/privacy_confidentiality/title_13_us_code.html). Title 13, U.S. Code, does not specify which subjects or questions are to be included in the decennial census. The next Census will be conducted nationwide in the year 2020.\n\nIn additional to the decennial census, the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html) is an ongoing survey that provides vital information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people. Information from the survey generates data that help determine how more than $675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year.\n\nThe United States has achieved [100% birth and death registration](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/).\n"}
