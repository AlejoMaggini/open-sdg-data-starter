As one of the first cities to adopt CEDAW, L.A. served as a model for its implementation by creating the Gender Equity Coalition \u2014 which includes a Gender Equity Liaison from every City Department \u2014 and directing the leadership of each Department to prepare a Gender Equity Action Plan, complete with quarterly plan progress reports, to measure and address disparities in the workforce."}
