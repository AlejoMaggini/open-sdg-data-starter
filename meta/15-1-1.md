**Non-Statistical Indicator**

The City of Los Angeles has approximately 6 million trees. Approximately 63 square miles (or 15% of the city total area) is zoned for Open Space which includes parts of the Santa Monica Mountains and Griffith Park. L.A.'s Green New Deal outlines two milestones to plant and maintain at least 90,000 trees and complete a citywide tree inventory by 2021.
