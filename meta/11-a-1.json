A General Plan is a comprehensive policy document that informs future land use decisions. It establishes land use designations and policies that identify a range of zoning options that can be applied to property. OurLA, the comprehensive update to the City\u2019s General Plan, will guide the physical and economic future of Los Angeles through the year 2040. OurLA aims to chart a course for the City\u2019s growth and change over the coming decades, tackling issues related to land use and economic development, water and energy, parks and open space, housing, mobility, air quality, and historic preservation.\n"}
